#Steem Swagger Client for Dart

Anyone can make one of thse for themselves, since @good-karma built a swagger API for steemd.  Of course, steemd itself should really have an inbuilt swagger API, but if others want to go on a-questing without ne, who am I to stop them? 

Much gratitude goes out to @good-karma.  Without the simple, clean interface he provides, it's far more likely this wourk couldn't exist.
